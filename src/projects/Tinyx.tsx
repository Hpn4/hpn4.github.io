            Each feature (posts, search, social interactions, timelines, media, users) is implemented as an independent service. Services communicate through Redis Streams, with decoupled read/write services for horizontal scalability. Data is persisted in MongoDB (content and timelines), ElasticSearch (search and hashtags), and Neo4j (social graph).

        <Section title="CI/CD">
          <Paragraph>
            We implemented GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate builds and deployments. On each push, the pipeline runs linting, compilation, and unit tests for every service. On tagged pushes (e.g. build-v1.2.3), services are packaged into Docker images and pushed to a private registry with the corresponding version tag.

        <Section title="Deployment">
          <Paragraph>
            All services run on a Kubernetes cluster, which pulls the Docker images from our registry.
